# Development notes

The services use delayed in-memory mock data, not a persistence or multi-user boundary. Favorites are client-session only and reset when the browser runtime reloads; UI synchronization uses the `favorites` TanStack Query cache.

Query keys are centralized in `src/lib/query-keys.ts`. Dynamic resources include their identifier, including dealer inventory (`["listings", "agency", agencyId]`).

Run `npm run typecheck`, `npm run lint`, `npm run build`, and `npm test` before delivery.

## Localization

UI translations live in the Arabic and English dictionaries in `src/lib/i18n.tsx`. Add every new key to both dictionaries, then read it in client components with `useI18n()`. To add a language, extend the `Locale` type, add its dictionary, direction, cookie handling, and locale tag in `src/lib/locale.ts`.

Use the helpers in `src/lib/locale.ts` for numbers, currency, dates, relative time, mileage, and years. Language and theme preferences are stored in `sd-locale` and `sd-theme` cookies so the server renders the correct language, direction, and theme after refresh; local storage mirrors the preference for client tooling.

## Vehicle discovery

Discovery state is parsed from the URL by `src/lib/vehicle-discovery.ts`. The reusable UI updates URL parameters, and `listingsService.discover()` owns all search, filter, sort, facet, and pagination behavior. TanStack Query keys include the normalized discovery parameters, so browser navigation and shared URLs restore the same results without coupling filtering to components.

To add a filter, extend `VehicleDiscoveryParams`, parse its URL value, add the service predicate, expose the control in `VehicleDiscovery`, and add both translations. A future backend can replace `listingsService.discover()` with a paginated API call while preserving the URL, component, and query-key contracts.
